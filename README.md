## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) - The resources on HTML provided by W3Schools were instrumental in helping me understand the structure and semantics of web pages. I particularly appreciated the clear explanations and practical examples, which I will continue to use in future projects.
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - The comprehensive guide on CSS by W3Schools significantly enhanced my understanding of styling and layout. The detailed tutorials and examples made it easier to grasp complex concepts, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their CSS skills.
- [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/javascript/) - W3Schools' JavaScript tutorials were incredibly helpful in demystifying the fundamentals of scripting and dynamic content. The step-by-step approach and practical exercises were invaluable in building my confidence and competence in JavaScript.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction) - documentation to get the basic understandings of the REST API's.
